    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p class = "info">I was born in a small town in North Dakota where I lived my entire life. After getting a degree in Mechanical Engineering I got a job as an engineer for an oil and gas company and was able to travel and meet people from all around the world, since then I've had the travel bug and there hasn't been a cure. I also like hiking, camping, coding (now), and long walks on the beach! I moved to Seattle in July to attend Code Fellows.</p>
